## Introduction
This app is for the course TDP028 at Link√∂ping University.
The main goal of the course is NOT the app itself but the fluff around the making of an app, such as:
* A/B-testing.
* Monetizing.
* Best practices in app-design.
* Gathering of statistical data concerning the use of my app.
* Making beneficial use of this statistical data.

## About the app
I am planning to make a simple game of the usual jog.
This includes:
* Running-missions app-wide where you compete on a local, country or world level.
* Achievements.
* Experience-points that lets the player level up.
* Titles for each level-bracket.

## Alpha version
The alpha version should be able to:
* Navigate between the different activities.
* All different views should be in place.
* It is not supposed to look good at all.
* There should be a map.

## Beta version
The beta version should be able to:
* User creation and log in.
* Should be able to track a run.
* Should be able to save the tracked run.
* Should be able to fetch run data from database.
* Get achievements.
* Get experience points.
* Level-Up.

## Gamma version
The gamma version should be able to:
* Share a run.
* Share "stats".

## Delta version
The delta version should be able to:
* Be able to have friends.
* Show friends/local/country/world brackets.

## Epsilon version
The epsilon version should be able to:
* User can now pick a team.
* Team brackets now exists.

## Where I Assume I'll end up when course finishes
Either Beta or Gamma version. This is due to other courses, me being new to Android, and that time is limited.
I have my hopes up.

## Lo-fi
The second version of the Lo-fi is seen here.
